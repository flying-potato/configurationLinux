I can connect to the "nyu" network using WPA2 enterprise every time and get a stable connection. The connections is authenticated using the Verisign Class 3 Public certificate as well.

Networking setup:
1. Follow the instructions in post #1 of this thread
2. For the CA certificate, select the "Verisign_Class_3_Primary_Public_Certification_Aut hority.pem" file from the /usr/ssl/certs directory

How to Connect
1. You will initially not see an "nyu" network. If there is one and you try to select it, you might be asked for a WEP key. Ignore this connection.
2. Select "Connect to Hidden Wireless Network" from the network manager icon and select the nyu profile you created. Click Connect.
3. After 10-20 seconds, the connection attempt will fail and bring up the connection settings window. This is normal. Do not try to connect again, click cancel
4. Go back to the Network Manager icon and you will notice a new "nyu" entry. Select this entry and enjoy your connection.


My computer setup:
Del M1330
Broadcom wireless chip (requires proprietary wl drivers)
kernel 2.6.28-13 (previous versions probably work)
Gnome using network manager


Note: If the above instructions do not work for some reason, try the other class 3 certificates, or download the certificate as given in this previous post:
